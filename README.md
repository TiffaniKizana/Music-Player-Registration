# RXPlayer - Music Player Registration
This is a website to handle the music player's user registration with an automatic system. It shows about RX Player, the top 10 songs on that week, and songs based on the genre. The user can select which privilege they want to use and register the account.

In this project, I use some basic web programing languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS, and a little jQuery.
